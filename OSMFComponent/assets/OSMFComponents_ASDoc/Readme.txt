Use these files to explore the ASDoc documentation for the code package.

To explore the documentation from your local hard drive, follow these steps:

1. Unzip the folder to your desktop, or any easy to access location on your computer.
2. In the folder, locate the index.html file and open in a browser. Notice that the first screen you see is an overview of the classes (scripts) in the ActionScript package (folders). 
3. Click the com.devnet.osmf.application link to drill down into the application package. Notice that there are three classes: Configuration, ControlBar, and MediaDisplay. These are the three primary objects you'll most likely deal with when working with code.
4. To explore the MediaDisplay API, for example, click the MediaDisplay link to view its API. You'll probably spend most of your time working with the functionality of this class. Browse down the page to view the list of properties, methods, events, and constants. You can use this resource to understand the available options.
5. Leave the browser window open when you're done so you can refer to it as needed.
